            HOWTO INSTALL CYANOGEN MOD 6 ON YOUR XPERIA MINI PRO

EVERYTHING YOU DO TO YOUR PHONE IS ENTIRELY YOUR OWN RESPOSIBILITY. IF YOU 
BRICK YOUR PHONE DURING THE PROCESS, ITS ABSOLUTELY YOUR OWN PROBLEM. YOU HAVE
BEEN WARNED. ONLY DO THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

- Root your phone. For instance, download `SuperOneClickv1.5.5-ShortFuse.zip' 
  here: http://www.mediafire.com/?7ytrvpiwi8i44mk
  Unfortunately, you'll need a Windows box for this to work properly, or you
  hack your way around Windows. Just get root some way.

- Once you've got root access, install the Xrecovery tool. Download the zip 
  file from here:
  http://www.mirrorcreator.com/files/QRPSMT2O/xRecovery-mini-0.1-beta-with_boot_fix.rar_links

  On your host machine, unpack the rar:
  $ unrar e xRecovery-mini-0.1-beta-with_boot_fix.rar

  Rename the correct chargemon script: (This is the correct one for xperia mini
  pro, YMMV)
  $ mv chargemon\ x10pro chargemon

  Now copy the files busybox, chargemon, charger and xrecovery.tar to your SD
  card. (Connect the phone via USB, make sure you can mount the SD card)
  # mount /dev/sdb1 /media/xperia
  # cp busybox chargemon charger xrecovery.tar /media/xperia
  # umount /media/xperia

  Make sure to deselect the USB copying of files for the SD card now on your 
  phone, so you see the SD card again under /sdcard on your phone

  On your Android phone, get a local shell, become root. Remount the /system
  partition read-write:
  # mount -o remount,rw /dev/block/mtdblock1 /system

  Copy busybox first: (Note that for some reason you can't use `mv' for this)
  # cat /sdcard/busybox /system/bin/busybox

  Change access mode for busybox: 
  # chmod 755 /system/bin/busybox

  Copy the rest with busybox:
  # busybox sh
  # cp /sdcard/chargemon /sdcard/charger /sdcard/xrecovery.tar /system/bin

  Change access mode for the remaining two executables:
  # chmod 755 /system/bin/chargemon /system/bin/charger

- Download some custom Cyanogen mod zip file. For instance, download version 6
  here: http://www.multiupload.com/SNT8G7DUDW
  After the zip file is downloaded, make sure the md5sum is correct:
  $ md5sum MiniCMPro_final.zip 
  7b3b3536285630316f28aaa09ecc71d0  MiniCMPro_final.zip

  Mount your SD card on the local host machine and copy the zip file:
  # mount /dev/sdb1 /media/xperia
  # cp MiniCMPro_final.zip /media/xperia
  # sync 
  # umount /media/xperia

- Reboot your phone. Keep pressing the back button while the phone is booting
  and you can see the white Sony Ericsson logo. This way you'll enter into the
  Xrecovery menu screen. Select to install a crustom ROM from there, and then
  select the directory where you stored your ROM before. Select the .zip file
  and choose to install it following the menu.

  The installation process will start and at the end, you'll see something like
  `Install from sdcard complete'. That's where you reboot your phone into the
  shiny new Cyanogen mod.

FAQ:

- Q: After flashing the phone with Cyanogen Mod 6, `final version', the phone
     keeps rebooting after the white Sony Ericsson logo. What can I do?
  A: I had to download and install Cyanogen Mod 6, v4. That one worked for me.
